# dag-anki-cards
This repository contains Anki cards in markdown format. The cards are organized in decks, one deck for each `.md` file. Each deck contains cards for a specific topic.

All cards are in English, except where otherwise specified.

## Disclaimer
All cards are derivative works of:
- my notes
- papers
- websites
- public documents (e.g. Google Docs, pdf...) that I have access to

The cards are provided as-is, without any warranty. Me and the original authors of the documents from which I took the cards are not responsible for any damage caused by the cards or any improper use of the cards. We are not liable in case you fail to learn anything because you relied on these cards, or in case of misinterpretation of the cards, or in case of any other problem. **Use at your own risk.**
Do not use these cards if you don't agree with the above.

## How to contribute
1. Fork this repository.
2. Edit or add cards in the `.md` files.
3. Create a pull request.
4. Done! I'll review your changes and merge them if they're good.

Do not commit markdown files with `<!-- -->` comments. They're used by the Obsidian_to_Anki plugin to generate the `.apkg` files. Not removing them will result in the cards not being updated.

If you need it, use this regex to remove them: `<!--[\s\S]*?-->` and after you're done, undo the changes to the `.md` files so you won't lose the progress you made on Anki.
