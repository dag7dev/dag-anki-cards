# dag-anki-cards
This repository contains Anki cards in markdown format. The cards are organized in decks, one deck for each `.md` file. Each deck contains cards for a specific topic.

All cards are in English, except where otherwise specified.

Spread markdown, not word documents or pdfs. :heart:

## Disclaimer
All cards are derivative works of:
- my notes
- papers
- websites
- public documents (e.g. Google Docs, pdf...) 

The cards are provided as-is, without any warranty. Me and the original authors of the documents are not responsible for any damage caused by the cards or any improper use of the cards. We are not liable in case you fail to learn anything because you relied on these cards, or in case of misinterpretation of the cards, or in case of any other problem. **Use at your own risk**.
The cards are obviously not guaranteed to be correct, complete, up-to-date or fit for any purpose. 
Think of them as a starting point for your studies, not as a replacement.

Do not use these cards if you don't agree with the above.

## How to contribute
1. Fork this repository.
2. Edit or add cards in the `.md` files.
3. Create a pull request.
4. Done! I'll review your changes and merge them if they're good.

Do not remove the `<!-- -->` lines. They're used by the Obsidian_to_Anki plugin to generate the `.apkg` files. Removing them will result in the cards not being updated.

Also, if using Markdown, remember to import the `.apkg` files in Anki to update the decks, otherwise you'll have to do it manually (since in md files the comments are present, so the extension thinks the cards are already in the deck).

If you need it, use this regex to remove them: `<!--[\s\S]*?-->` and after you're done, undo the changes to the `.md` files so you won't lose tyour progress on Anki.

## Why
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes. Obsidian is a markdown editor that allows you to create links between notes. It also has a wonderful plugin called [Obsidian_to_Anki] that allows you to export markdown notes to Anki cards. I use Anki to memorize things.

Markdown is a wonderful format for taking notes, but it's not very good for memorizing things. Anki is a wonderful tool for memorizing things, but it's not very good for taking notes. This repository is an attempt to combine the two.
